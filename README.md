#### Description:

    My project reflects my journey from primary school until now. I am a dedicated student who appreciates learning new skills, loves exploring AI topics, and dreams of studying at Harvard. I am a web developer, video editor, graphic designer, long-term investor, and STEM researcher.

    My project contains several files: index.html, style.css, and script.js. It also includes multiple folders: shapes, img, and icons. I have organized everything to be clear and easy to understand.

    Firstly, index.html is the file that provides the primary structure of my website. It contains the text, images, and information without any styling. I made sure to classify each element properly and followed the latest HTML standards for clarity. The second file, style.css, defines the website’s appearance. It handles the hovers, padding, layout, and all other design elements. It also incorporates other CSS files like normalize.css. Finally, the third file, script.js, adds interactivity and makes the website dynamic, responding to user input.

    I used my image editing and Adobe Photoshop skills to create the images displayed on my website, all of which are stored in the img folder. Additionally, I downloaded icons and shapes to further enhance the website’s design and make it more visually appealing.

The final project consists of several sections. The first is the header, which contains various hyperlinks that redirect you to different parts of the website. The second part, which I call the "Home" section, provides brief information about me and my passions. You’ll also find links to my social media accounts and other relevant details. The third section is the "About Me" section, where I showcase my skills, honors, and the academic education I’ve received. Everything is organized and styled in an appealing way. The fourth section is dedicated to the courses I’ve taken. I’ve organized it into three categories: tech-related courses, STEM-related courses, and business-related courses. I’ve also included certificates and detailed information about each course. Following that is the "Projects" section, where I list the projects I’ve worked on — though it’s not yet complete. Finally, there's the "Contact" section, which serves as the footer of the website.

To sum up, this is the largest project I’ve ever undertaken. It took me about three weeks to complete. I am proud of my work and hope you appreciate it too. Thank you, CS50!
