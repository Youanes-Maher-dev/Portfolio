    <h1>Kepler-452b</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From about 30 years ago, there was not any scientific
            proof of a planet outside our solar system. But thanks 
            to advanced technology like (HWO) we have discovered thousands 
            of exoplanets, which made humans ask themselves (Are we alone in the universe?)
            Designing a habitable world involves considering various factors that support
            life as we know it. These include the mass, the radius, gravity, the planet's
            distance from its host star (it should be in the habitable zone), atmosphere, magnetic field, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Firstly, we have used Proxima Centauri b because of its suitable mass and radius which are 1.07 times
            the mass of the Earths, and 1.03 times the radius of the Earth. This combination will lead to a gravity 
            like the Earth of about 1.008 times the Earth (by the law of gravitational field which is equal to GM/r2). 
            It also will give us the same mass of the atmosphere like the Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Secondly, the sun of our planet will be a G-type star called Kepler-452 b, 
            which is approximately like our sun, only 3.7% more massive and 11% larger. 
            Its temperature is nearly like our sun which is 5757 K. Our planet will rotate 
            in the orbit of Kepler-452b which will lead to a temperature of 265 K (−8 °C; 17 °F).
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thirdly, determination of climate and temperature have an important impact. 
            The equilibrium temperature recorded on Kepler 452 b suggests the possibility 
            of a climate like that of Earth, perhaps allowing for the presence of liquid water 
            on its surface. This trait is crucial in nurturing and sustaining life as we know it.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourthly, we determined the composition of the atmosphere, which is composed of nitrogen, 
            oxygen, other gases like carbon dioxide. We choose these components because; nitrogen helps 
            in maintaining atmospheric pressure and is an essential nutrient for many organisms, oxygen allows 
            organisms to convert food to energy, and carbon dioxide helps regulate the planet's temperature by trapping 
            heat. The planet must contain a soil to produce nitrogen from bacteria, also there must be plants to provide 
            us by oxygen through photosynthesis. This cycle will keep the percentage of components of atmosphere the same over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fifthly, magnetic field is produced from conducting electricity because 
            the core contains conductivity material which is iron or nickel and this 
            result a magnetic field in our planet.  The importance of magnetic field is 
            protection atmosphere from harmful radiation by deflecting charged particles. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To conclude that, the past 30 years have brought remarkable advancements in our
            understanding of exoplanets, fueling our curiosity about life beyond our solar system 
            sun. By considering factors like mass, radius, gravity, distance from the star, atmosphere, 
            and magnetic field, we can envision habitable worlds with conditions similar to Earth. These 
            discoveries pave the way for further exploration and the possibility of finding life elsewhere in 
            the vast expanse of the universe.
